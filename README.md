## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The publication of this code aims to:
- Share the results of this final projectâ€™s research and development with the public, particularly in the context of implementing semantic segmentation for building density detection.
- Facilitate the reproduction of experiments by other researchers working on similar topics.
- Provide a reference for developers or researchers who wish to utilize or further develop this final projectâ€™s research.




## ðŸ›  Technologies / Environment Used
[running with Kaggle Notebook] with:
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow / PyTorch / Keras
- Sklearn
- -U segmentation-models
- Jaccard Coefficient for accuration metrics



## ðŸš€ Masking Image for Dataset
Before making mask dataset, image dataset should be labelled as masking of image dataset. On this final project used Label Studio with 2000 image dataset.
